get line #
make node for each line with constant value
pulse single line for each node from input
try to pulse
w*x
weight * number of connected nodes
10 lines = 10 pulses
if pulse fails
reduce synapse weight
weight

A++ and A = good

a	d
b	e
c	f
mark each node we've used
if node matches increment
else
reduce weight, sort array by weight
essentially brute force at the beginning
use two lists, one unused, one used(open and closed)

USE REGEX TO TELL A NEURON WHAT IT'S DOING UNTIL SUB NET GETS DOWN TO WORDS THEN IF NEEDED GO TO LETTERS

If the node fails(percentage decreases) reduce synapse weight and trace back a step
